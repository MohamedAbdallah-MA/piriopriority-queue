# piriopriority-queue
## About the project 
priority queue project is a c++ implementation of priority queue algorithm 
that is so important for cpu to dedicate what the process must be executed first
my project takes the number of process , burst time for each process and the priority for each process
and show the order of processes that will be executed , the waiting time for each process , the average waiting time and the grand chart


## Input
1 - Number of processes
2 - burst time for each process
3 - priority for each process


## Output
1 - table contains the order for each process and the waiting time for each process
2 - the average waiting time
3 - grand chart

### Note this project was my seconde term project in my seconde year at modern academy
